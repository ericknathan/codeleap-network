# CodeLeap Network
CodeLeap Network is a social network application developed to manage posts on an API provided by CodeLeap. With a friendly and intuitive interface, the application allows users to view, update and delete their posts.

When opening the application, users are presented with a list of API posts, organized chronologically. They can add new posts, edit or delete existing posts.

## Avaliation key points
- In general, you should develop this as if it‚Äôs targeted for an end consumer, not for other developers. Try to impress the user within the design limitations, not just the developers.
- Your project should look exactly like these designs here, and you will not be assessed for making the designs radically customised. You can try to surprise us, but do so at your own risk!
- Consistency is key so make sure everything looks nice, neat, symmetrical and spaced correctly.
- Usability is paramount. Make sure a regular person would be able to understand and use the interface easily in different scenarios, starting points, devices or screen sizes.
- Attention to details. Please make sure you carefully look at all details in this page.
- Keep it simple. On your code, you will be assessed by how effectively you can achieve this task and reutilise your own code. We‚Äôre looking for people with are objective and results oriented.
- Deliver quickly. Although this is not the only criteria, we will judge your results based on how quickly you deliver this test once started.

## Avaliation bonus points
- [x] Make it responsive on mobile devices.
